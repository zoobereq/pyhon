A project that combines text drawing in the canvas with timers in an effort to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch contains "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons. 

The script runs locally from the command line but it does require the modules listed below.  Make sure you install them first (pip install {module name}).
